        Deep learning has been successful with GANs, which can be used to create realistic pictures and improve existing ones. However, they can also be used to deceive individuals by generating false data, such as fake faces and synthetic photographs for identification and authentication purposes.
        Advanced picture editing software such as Adobe Photoshop allows for the alteration of complicated input photographs and the creation of high-quality new images. YouTube has step-by-step directions and tutorials for making fictitious graphics, which can be used for defamation, impersonation, and factual distortion. Social media allows fraudulent material to be quickly and extensively shared on the Internet.
